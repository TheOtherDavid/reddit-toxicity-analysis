# Reddit Toxicity Analysis
Reddit Toxicity Analysis is a project designed to compare sentiment between different subreddits. I've always gotten the impression that one subreddit seems nice and friendly, while another can seem toxic and hostile. I want to see if this shows itself in the data!

This tool uses the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library for accessing Reddit data and PostgreSQL for data storage.
